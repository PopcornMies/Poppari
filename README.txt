This regression model was done as a part of an exam in relevant uni course.

Exam instructions:

1. Filter the movies metadata (max. 5 points):
• Original language: English
• Revenue greater than zero
• Budget greater than zero

2. Calculate average GroupLens ratings for movies (ratings.csv) and merge these with movies
metadata

3. Using the filtered and merged data, estimate a basic linear regression model in which the
dependent variable is logged movie revenue, and the independent variables are:
• The average GroupLens rating: 5 points
• Logged budget: 5 points
• Runtime: 5 points
• BONUS: Belongs to some collection (yes/no): max. 2 points
• BONUS: Release decade (e.g., …,1970, 1980, 1990, …): max. 2 points
• BONUS: Main genre name (first mentioned): max. 2 points
• BONUS: Logged total revenue of the previously released movies from the given
production companies: max. 2 points**
• BONUS: Use heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors: max. 2 points


4. Write max. one page document in which you report the main regression results (i.e., copypaste the results table), and explain (i.e., not just report, but elaborate) whether and how
much the average movie rating affects movie revenue? (max. 10 points)

Exam results:
44.5 / 60
